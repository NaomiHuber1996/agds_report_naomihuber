## Provision of the two links to the two repositories on my GitHub account
As the exercise 7 was about the GitHub collaboration work and there is no specific data we had to write, I provide the two links for my work:
```{r}
# Link to the repository which is called "ReportExercise7"

"https://github.com/NaomiHuber1996/ReportExercise7.git"
```

```{r}
# Link to the repository which is called "7.4-Collaborative_Work-on-Github"

"https://github.com/NaomiHuber1996/7.4-Collaborative-Work-on-Github.git"
```
